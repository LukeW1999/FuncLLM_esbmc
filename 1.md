Straight from Spec to assertion:
To address your request, we'll break down the meaning and possible range of 'input' and 'output' for the given C code, convert the specification requirements into oracles, and use C code constructs (like if statements and ESBMC assertions) to represent the requirements. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step approach:
1. Meaning and Possible Range of 'input' and 'output':
Inputs:
ia, ib, ic (Double):
Description: These represent signals from branches A, B, and C that are being monitored.
Range: Any double-precision floating-point value that the application platform supports.
Tlevel (Double):
Description: Threshold level that defines a miscompare condition between any two signals.
Range: Positive double value, representing an acceptable discrepancy level.
PClimit (Integer):
Description: Maximum persistence count allowed before a fault is latched.
Range: Positive integer.
Outputs:
PC (Integer):
Description: Current persistence count for the duration of miscompare.
Range: Non-negative integer.
TC (Integer):
Description: Totalizer count representing the accumulated number of miscompares.
Range: Non-negative integer.
FC (Integer):
Description: Latched fault code indicating fault status.
Range: Integer values that indicate specific fault states.
set_val (Double):
Description: Selected value between the monitored signals.
Range: Any double value within the possible range of ia, ib, ic.



### Requirements and Corresponding ESBMC Assertions

---

### Requirement [RM-001]
**In the no-fail state, a mis-compare, which shall be characterized by one branch differing with the other two branches by a unique trip level that lasts for more than the persistence limit, shall be reported to failure management as a failure.**

**ESBMC Assertion for Mis-Compare in No-Fail State:**

if (fabs(rtU.ia - rtU.ib) > rtU.Tlevel || fabs(rtU.ib - rtU.ic) > rtU.Tlevel || fabs(rtU.ia - rtU.ic) > rtU.Tlevel) {
    rtDW.PC++; // Increment persistence count
    if (rtDW.PC > rtU.PClimit) {
        __ESBMC_assert(rtY.FC == 1, "Failure should be reported if mis-compare persists beyond persistence limit");
    }
} else {
    rtDW.PC = 0; // Reset persistence count if no miscompare
}

---

### Requirement [RM-002]
**In the no-fail state, the mid-value shall be the selected value. Note: a first failure in progress will not affect the method for determining the selected value.**

**ESBMC Assertion for Selecting Mid-Value in No-Fail State:**

if (rtDW.Merge_e[2] == 0) { // No-fail state
    double mid_val;
    if ((rtU.ia <= rtU.ib && rtU.ib <= rtU.ic) || (rtU.ic <= rtU.ib && rtU.ib <= rtU.ia)) {
        mid_val = rtU.ib;
    } else if ((rtU.ib <= rtU.ia && rtU.ia <= rtU.ic) || (rtU.ic <= rtU.ia && rtU.ia <= rtU.ib)) {
        mid_val = rtU.ia;
    } else {
        mid_val = rtU.ic;
    }
    __ESBMC_assert(rtY.set_val == mid_val, "Selected value should be the mid-value in no-fail state");
}

---

### Requirement [RM-003]
**In the single fail state, a good channel average of the remaining two good branches shall be used to determine the selected value.**

**ESBMC Assertion for Good Channel Average in Single-Fail State:**

if (rtDW.Merge_e[2] == 1) { // Single-fail state
    double avg_val = (rtU.ia + rtU.ic) / 2.0; // Assuming branch B failed
    __ESBMC_assert(rtY.set_val == avg_val, "Selected value should be the good channel average in single-fail state");
}

---

### Requirement [RM-004]
**If a second failure is in progress, the selected value shall remain unchanged from the previous selected value.**

**ESBMC Assertion for Second Failure State:**

if (rtDW.Merge_e[2] == 2) { // Pending second failure
    __ESBMC_assert(rtY.set_val == rtDW.Merge, "Selected value should remain unchanged during pending second failure");
}
